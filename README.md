### Machine Learning Pipeline on Personal Audio Data

This repository contains a series of machine learning pipelines developed iteratively over time to analyze audio data from my personal digital archive. The project explores how different modeling choices, data representations, and evaluation strategies affect performance when working with small, real-world datasets.

Across the three iterations, I build an end-to-end ML pipeline that includes data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction (notably MFCCs), model training, evaluation, and interpretation. Each version extends the previous one, both technically and methodologically, reflecting a progression from baseline models to more expressive architectures and more rigorous experimental design.

A central focus of this work is understanding machine learning as a system: how data quantity, segmentation, training time, and model complexity interact to constrain what conclusions can reasonably be drawn. Rather than optimizing for a single metric, the project emphasizes careful evaluation, failure analysis, and clear explanation of results and limitations.
